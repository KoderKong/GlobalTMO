# GlobalTMO
Contrast-limited histogram equalization method and apparatus for a wide-dynamic range CMOS image sensor with a monotonic response.

# TMO 2021
Clone the repository and change your path to its folder. Run the script, 'LXFXtest.m', to test a sample-based Simulink model, 'LXFXsys.slx', that matches in bit-true fashion a frame-based MATLAB representation, 'TMO2021.m', of a remodeled contrast-limited histogram equalization design [1, 2].

# TMO 2025
Run the script, 'LXFItest.m', to test a Simulink model, 'LXFIsys.slx', that matches in bit-true fashion a MATLAB representation, 'TMO2025.m', of an exponentially improved contrast-limited histogram equalization design [1, 2]. Please see the pending publication for details.
